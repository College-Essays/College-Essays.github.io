  <h1>College Application Essays</h1>
  <p>Your essays are the defining elements in your college application. For most applicants, the strength of your essay, in how it demonstrates the breadth of your experiences and characteristics, in how it explains both what you are seeking from the school of your choice and what you can offer as a student, will make all the difference between an admission and a rejection.</p>
  <p>As an applicant to universities that are highly ranked, you cannot rely on the strength of your academic performance to obtain an admission letter. The vast majority of your competitors will have superb GPAs and their transcripts will have the same AP, IB, and college courses, the same test scores and certifications you have. The same logic applies to your extracurricular activities. The summers that you spent volunteering at the city library, the time you spent after school tutoring at-risk students, and the fact that you participated in at least two sports per year makes your application appealing, but you have to remember that generally speaking, everyone applying to the colleges you want to be admitted to will have done activities that are nearly identical in terms of volunteerism. A distinguished record is unfortunately not a selling point, it is merely a minimum requirement.</p>
  <p>In addition, the number of open seats is smaller than it seems. A certain number of applicants will be the people who have, for lack of a better word, perfect applications. These are the people who have won spelling bees, math decathlons, state science fairs, and rowing championships. They will have spent summers attending youth programs in Geneva, digging wells in Ghana, or attending conferences hosted by former presidents. Their parents are the schoolâ€™s donors. These applicants will almost certainly be admitted to the schools they apply to - these are the students colleges dangle scholarships and stipends to attract - and this will have the effect of shrinking the number of seats available for 'normal' applicants, making the process even more competitive for the seats that are left.</p>
  <p>Finally, the letters of recommendation you receive from your teachers or the people who supervised your extracurricular activities will be, if not for the fact that they are required, a waste of paper. The people reading these letters are not going to be persuaded to admit you based on the opinions of your teachers and professors, especially when every application they look at will have a similar letter with a similar pitch from a similar person. Consider how weak your overall application must be if you are counting on a letter of recommendation to swing the odds in your favor. This is not a position you want to be in and the position effects of a glowing and well-argued letter of recommendation is, at best, marginal. It is no coincidence that a growing number of universities are waiving the recommendation requirements.</p>
  <p>This leaves your essays as the most important part of your application. Your essays will be the one element that you can use to distinguish yourself from other applicants, the one method through which you can leave an actual impression on the people reading your application. Your essays will be the key element in turning you from a stack of papers to an individual, a human layer on top of numbers and a static list of accomplishments. Your essays are your only opportunity to essentially say 'Look, I have the numbers and the softs (as does everyone one), but as an individual, I have more to offer than the other people whose applications you are reading.' This seems overly harsh (and your essay will not be so blunt and tasteless) but the entire process is a competition in a true zero-sum sense. Your essays are the only place where your application is more than the sum of columns in a spreadsheet.</p>
  <p><strong>This is where what I have to offer comes in.</strong></p>
  <p>Taking your background and experiences into account, I will help you narrow down the key ideas you will use, focus, and elaborate upon to flesh out who you are and what you can offer to the college of your choice. I will help you write an essay that conveys the fact that just as you have much to gain as a student at the college of your choice, the school will have much to gain from having you as a student. I will help you write an essay such that when the people deciding upon your application are reading it, they will feel that denying your application will be a loss for their school.</p>
  <p>With my help, you can be confident that your essay is not only the best essay it can be in a general sense, but the best and most compelling argument in favor of your admission. When we are finished with your essay, you will feel assured that whoever ends up reading that essay will pause and mull over what you have written, that you will go from an anonymous applicant to someone that not only can fully utilize the benefits of an education at their school, but will also bring in a perspective that will add to the aggregate wealth of knowledge and experiences contained within the school.</p>
  <p>I have a proven history of helping students gain admission to elite schools of their choice. People I have worked with have gotten into UC Berkeley, UCLA School of Law, USC School of Law, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, Bard College, Boston University School of Law, Pacific University School of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Midwestern University, the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Vanderbilt Law School and other highly ranked universities and programs.</p>
